## 📖 About the project
The project is about getting EV users to load more sustainable, loading green cars is not as green as people think, when we load at the wrong moment the energy that is loaded into the EV is not green at all, it consists of energy produced by coal/gas stations, this means we are not driving green at all.

The CO2 emitted at other moments of the same day are far less and that moments should be motivated to EV users, because the driving of green cars is much greener when loading at that certain moment.
